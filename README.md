# SimpleJavaRemoteDesktopAdministration
This is a simple Java Remote Desktop Administration Tool written for my undergrad Java Lab.

This program is done with the help of several methods of robot class which is used to automate keyboard and mouse.

Explaination of robots class is tried to be done with two programs collected from the internet namely robo1 and robo2 included with the repo

#To run program

java -jar <server or client>.jar
  
  
#Testing

Testing was done on cross-platform
where server was running on Arch Linux and Client was Windows 7
Devices were in Local Area Network

This can be used on WAN after doing port forwarding on server

This can be upgraded with additional functionality of over WAN connection without port forwarding with SSH Tunneling
